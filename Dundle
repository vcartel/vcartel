Please download and install a VPN that allows you to connect to a server located in Netherlands (NL)
Connect to the NL server
Choose a VoIP service that allows to call in Netherlands for free (or offers a very cheap rate)
Go to the website https://dundle.com
Choose your Visa or Mastercard virtual card and its balance amount
Go to checkout with your article in the basket
Choose Pay Per Minuut as payment method
Open your softphone that you previously set up with your VoIP provider account (CommPeak, Telnyx, VoHippo, etc.)
Call the number that will appear and remember to use the NL area code +31 before the number (the central 0 sometimes it's mandatory to compose, otherwise you need to avoid to digit it, try)
Listen the code that the automatic voice give you, but be carefull because it will be pronunced with NL language, so you could need a real time translator to understand any digit
Enter the code into the field with the keyboard of your softphone or web plugin that allows to make calls
Click on Enter (or OK) on the web page and remain in the call on VoIP, until you'll complete the time equal to the card balance

Remember: 1 min. in call = 1€ of balance, so if you choose a card with 100€ balance, you must stay on the call for 100 minutes and this is for any card you want to have.

N.B.: it's clear that you have a VoIP that allows to call in NL for free, you won't pay to reamin all the necessary time to get your card with the balance you choose;
it's okay even if you use a real SIM card in your phone, if you have a good rate to call in NL, so you'll have the card for few cents. or so

THE END
